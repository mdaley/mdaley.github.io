I am a software engineer based in Bristol, United Kingdom. I currently work for [MixRadio](http://mixradiomusic.com), 
a global provider of music streaming services. My career has spanned a wide range of technologies and approaches, with 
my focus in the last few years being developing and maintaining clojure services deployed into the AWS cloud. I am
married with two teenage children and spend much of my spare time playing the piano in jazz groups.
