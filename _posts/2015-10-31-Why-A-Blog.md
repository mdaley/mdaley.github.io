title: Why a blog?
---

This is more for me than anyone else. I find that I forget things if I don't write them down; and then I mislay the piece
of paper that I wrote on. Perhaps this blog will be harder to mislay!

I've often wondered about working in an internet startup, of starting something technological from scratch. But what would be the best
way to get something up-and-running quickly, and on a small budget. MixRadio has open sourced some technology
that should help with this; and my initial blogging will be about my attempts to use this to build a continuous delivery 
process as quickly and simply as possible.

For more information about the technologies I'll be using, head over to [MixRadio's github pages](https://github.com/mixradio).
