This is more for me than anyone else. I find that I forget things if I don't write them down; and then I mislay the piece
of paper that I wrote on. Perhaps this blog will be harder to mislay!

I've often wondered about the technical side of working in an internet startup, about how one could go about starting something from scratch. But what would be the best
way to get something up-and-running quickly, and on a small budget? MixRadio, my current employer, has open sourced some technology
that should help with this. Whilst the technology works exceedingly well in a more mature larger scale setup, I thought it would be interesting to see how easy it would be to use it to build, deploy and manage services in a small startup context. The open sourced code is intended to allow this, but I'm not aware of anyone who has tried ... so I thought I would!

For more information about the technologies I'll be using, head over to [MixRadio's github pages](https://github.com/mixradio).
